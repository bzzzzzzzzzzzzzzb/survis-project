  abstract = {Due to a battery constraint in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), prolonging their lifetime is important. Energy-efficient routing techniques for WSNs play a great role in doing so. In this paper, we articulate this problem and classify current routing protocols for WSNs into two categories according to their orientation toward either homogeneous or heterogeneous WSNs. They are further classified into static and mobile ones. We give an overview of these protocols in each category by summarizing their characteristics, limitations, and applications. Finally, some open issues in energy-efficient routing protocol design for WSNs are indicated.},

  abstract = {Metrics are investigated to help assess the performance of wireless sensors in buildings. Wireless sensor networks present tremendous opportunities for energy savings and improvement in occupant comfort in buildings by making data about conditions and equipment more readily available. A key barrier to their adoption, however, is the uncertainty among users regarding the reliability of the wireless links through building construction. Tests were carried out that examined three performance metrics as a function of transmitter–receiver separation distance, transmitter power level, and obstruction type. These tests demonstrated, via the packet delivery rate, a clear transition from reliable to unreliable communications at different separation distances. While the packet delivery rate is difficult to measure in actual applications, the received signal strength indication correlated well with the drop in packet delivery rate in the relatively noise-free environment used in these tests. The concept of an equivalent distance was introduced to translate the range of reliability in open field operation to that seen in a typical building, thereby providing wireless system designers a rough estimate of the necessary spacing between sensor nodes in building applications. It is anticipated that the availability of straightforward metrics on the range of wireless sensors in buildings will enable more widespread sensing in buildings for improved control and fault detection.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has become a de facto approach for service provisioning over the Internet. It operates relying on a pool of shared computing resources available on demand and usually hosted in data centers. Assessing performance and energy efficiency of data centers becomes fundamental. Industries use a number of metrics to assess efficiency and energy consumption of cloud computing systems, focusing mainly on the efficiency of IT equipment, cooling and power distribution systems. However, none of the existing metrics is precise enough to distinguish and analyze the performance of data center communication systems from IT equipment. This paper proposes a framework of new metrics able to assess performance and energy efficiency of cloud computing communication systems, processes and protocols. The proposed metrics have been evaluated for the most common data center architectures including fat tree three-tier, BCube, DCell and Hypercube.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a group of small power-constrained nodes that sense data and communicate it to the base station (BS). These nodes cover a vast region of interest (ROI) for several purposes according to the application need. The first challenge encountered in WSNs is how to cover the ROI perfectly and send the monitored data to the BS. Although the energy introduced during setup phase and the violation of energy fairness constraint of dynamic routing topologies, they achieve high network performance in terms of coverage and connectivity. In this paper, we categorize the applications of WSN based on different aspects to show the major protocol design issues. Thus, the energy efficiency of the recent proactive routing protocols is studied from different angles. The energy overhead and energy fairness of each protocol were carefully analyzed. The most energy efficient routing protocols for homogeneous proactive networks were studied and compared to highlight the research challenges and existing problems in this area. The results proved that energy overhead and route selection are the most effective aspects of network lifetime and network efficiency.},

@article{Pantazis2013Survey,
  abstract = {The distributed nature and dynamic topology of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) introduces very special requirements in routing protocols that should be met. The most important feature of a routing protocol, in order to be efficient for WSNs, is the energy consumption and the extension of the network's lifetime. During the recent years, many energy efficient routing protocols have been proposed for WSNs. In this paper, energy efficient routing protocols are classified into four main schemes: Network Structure, Communication Model, Topology Based and Reliable Routing. The routing protocols belonging to the first category can be further classified as flat or hierarchical. The routing protocols belonging to the second category can be further classified as Query-based or Coherent and non-coherent-based or Negotiation-based. The routing protocols belonging to the third category can be further classified as Location-based or Mobile Agent-based. The routing protocols belonging to the fourth category can be further classified as QoS-based or Multipath-based. Then, an analytical survey on energy efficient routing protocols for WSNs is provided. In this paper, the classification initially proposed by Al-Karaki, is expanded, in order to enhance all the proposed papers since 2004 and to better describe which issues/operations in each protocol illustrate/enhance the energy-efficiency issues.},

In health care in particular, sensors and data links offer potential for constant monitoring of patient’s symptoms and needs, in real time, enabling physicians to diagnose and monitor health problems wherever the patient is, either at home or outdoors. However, the use of Internet of Things concepts in the health domain does not come without extra data and therefore a data transfer cost overheads. To deal with these overheads, novel metrics, and methods are introduced in an attempt to maximize the capabilities and widen acceptance/usage provided by the Internet of Things. Without losing its generality, the method discussed is experimentally evaluated in the paradigm of the Health domain. The focus is on the need for an overview of available data formats and transmission methods and selection of the optimal combination, which can result to reduction/minimization of costs. An analytic methodology is presented backed with theoretical metrics and evaluated experimentally.},

@article{s19204579,
  abstract = {Cluster-based hierarchical routing protocols play an essential role in decreasing the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) has been proposed as an application-specific protocol architecture for WSNs. However, without considering the distribution of the cluster heads (CHs) in the rotation basis, the LEACH protocol will increase the energy consumption of the network. To improve the energy efficiency of the WSN, we propose a novel modified routing protocol in this paper. The newly proposed improved energy-efficient LEACH (IEE-LEACH) protocol considers the residual node energy and the average energy of the networks. To achieve satisfactory performance in terms of reducing the sensor energy consumption, the proposed IEE-LEACH accounts for the numbers of the optimal CHs and prohibits the nodes that are closer to the base station (BS) to join in the cluster formation. Furthermore, the proposed IEE-LEACH uses a new threshold for electing CHs among the sensor nodes, and employs single hop, multi-hop, and hybrid communications to further improve the energy efficiency of the networks. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with some existing routing protocols, the proposed protocol substantially reduces the energy consumption of WSNs.},
